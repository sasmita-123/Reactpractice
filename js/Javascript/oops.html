        <h2>What is the Purpose of OOPs</h2>
        <h3>For security, reuse the code</h3>
        <h4>Qualities:-Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism basically used in serverside</h4>
        <h5>There are two approach <b>class approach</b> and <b>functional approach(with some limitation)</b>fast in processing</h5>
        <p>
            What is Class, Instance, Inheritance, Constructor, extend keyword<br>
            <I>Class is a collection of properties and methods</I> <br>
            Class name starts with Capital letter<br>
            <section> Student{
                name;<br>
                city;<br>
                setDetails(){}
            }</section>
            <h2>memory or instance of Class is also called object and create as NEW keyword as new Stu</h2><br>
            <h3>var s1 = new Student()<br>
            s1.name<br>
            s1.getDetails()</h3>
        </p>
        <h1>Instance of class is called object.<br>
            Wrapping of methods or properties as class into a single unit is called Encapsulation</h1>
            <h2>Class is userdefine datatype collection of properties and metohd..<br>
                memory special operator New and constructor</h2>
                <h1>Inheritance</h1>
                <h3>Parent-Child relationship</h3><br>
                <br>
                <h4>If code is step by step is called synchronous</h4>
                <h1>Asynchronous flow means multi threading parallally code run if no component is independent with each other</h1>
